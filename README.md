**Unsolved Problems**

* We are developing editable posts.
* We are also developing login logic.

**What We learned**

It was so beneficial working on a team. Problem solving is better in a group setting. Designing is better in a group setting. And we were able to work faster for longer periods of time. 

**Version 2**

Version 2 will allow users to pin their journeys on a virtual map of the world, using the Google Maps API.

**Improvements from Project Three**
* Confidence in code
* More diverse problem-solving
* Learned better work ethic in a team
* Git navigation is much stronger
* Wrote DRY-er, more readible and more organized code
* Focused on one task at a time
* With more resources in teammates, motivation was increased


**Our Proudest Moment**

Our proudest moment was learning to communicate efficiently with each other. When we split Frontend between Diane and Ninti and Backend between Marco and Beth, we worked quickly through the first sprint. We were able to come together to achieve all the other sprints as a team.

**My Weakest Moment**

We had to learn to listen to multiple solutions.
